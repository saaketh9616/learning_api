# Learning API
After making this mini project I learnt about promises and how to fetch data from multiple API's. This website fetches data from 2 API's(one for the quote and one for the background images(UNSPLASH API)) and displays the quote and changes the background with a single click.Whenever you want to read some quotes you can visit this webpageðŸ˜Š.
